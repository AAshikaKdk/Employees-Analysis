**Project Summary:**

Dashboard analysing the Gender Roleplay in a company in different aspects. 

We have always heard about gender disparity at workplace so I wanted to see how the data would lead to us in this argument.

**Skills Used:**
- SQL to analyze and format the data.
- Tableau to visualize the findings.


Desired Insights:

1. What is the distribution of male and female employees in terms of gender representation within the workforce?
2. How does average annual income vary by gender over time in different departments?
3. What is the gender distribution among managers in terms of representation?
4. What is the average salary for males and females in various departments?
